## Details

### What is Qubex?

We propose to develop **Qubex**, a **community-driven platform** that allows users to trade assets and exchange tokens within the Qubic ecosystem. Qubex will enable swapping of tokens such as **USDT, USDC, ETH to QUBIC and vice versa**, and is designed for future expansion to include additional cryptocurrencies. It will also lay the groundwork for potential integration of a **FIAT Ramp**, facilitating conversions between fiat currency and QUBIC. Qubex will provide additional features for possible adaptations to full exchanges and will generate profits, **a portion of which (5%) will be allocated back to the Qubic Ecosystem Fund**, supporting the growth and sustainability of the community.

## Technical Implementation Overview

### Tech Stack

To ensure the successful development and scalability of Qubex, we have selected a robust and modern tech stack:

- **Frontend:**
  - **Next.js**: For a performant and responsive user interface.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: For efficient and customizable styling.

- **Backend:**
  - **Solidity**: For Ethereum-based interactions.
  - **LayerZero.network**: For cross-chain bridging functionality.

- **Smart Contracts:**
  - **Development and integration of smart contracts** for blockchain interactions.

- **Database:**
  - **PostgreSQL**: Chosen for its reliability, robustness, and support for complex queries. PostgreSQL offers advanced features like transactional integrity and scalability, which are essential for securely handling financial data and user information.

- **Hosting & Infrastructure:**
  - **Ubuntu Servers**: For deploying production environments.
  - **Docker**: For containerization and consistent deployment.
  - **Load Balancing & Geographical Distribution**: Implemented across multiple regions to enhance performance and reliability.

- **Security:**
  - **OWASP Best Practices**: To ensure secure software development.
  - **External Security Audits**: To validate the security of platform infrastructure.

### Added Value of PostgreSQL

Using PostgreSQL provides the following benefits:

- **Data Integrity and Security**: Ensures transactional consistency, which is crucial for financial applications handling sensitive data.
- **Scalability**: Efficiently manages large volumes of data, accommodating future growth and high transaction volumes.
- **Extensibility**: Supports custom functions, full-text search, and advanced indexing, allowing flexibility in development.
- **Robust Community and Support**: Benefit from continuous updates, security patches, and a wealth of documentation and community expertise.

### Backup Strategy and Offsite Storage

To ensure data integrity and availability, we will implement a robust backup strategy:

- **Regular Backups:** Automated daily incremental and weekly full backups.
- **Offsite Storage:** Secure storage of backups in separate, reliable locations such as **Google Cloud Storage** to ensure data recovery in case of regional failures.

### Bridge Implementation

The bridge functionality is a critical component of Qubex, enabling seamless cross-chain transactions between Ethereum, Qubic, and other supported blockchains. The setup with **LayerZero.network** will facilitate this functionality.

---

### Transaction Flow for Cross-Chain Messaging

1. **User Initiates Transaction**  
   The user initiates a transaction in the DApp, triggering MetaMask Snap for wallet interaction.

2. **MetaMask Snap Initialized**  
   MetaMask Snap manages user wallet and transaction details.

3. **Transaction Forwarding**  
   MetaMask Snap forwards transaction details to LayerZero Endpoint V2 for cross-chain message handling.

4. **LayerZero Endpoint Version 2**  
   The LayerZero protocol receives transaction details to enable cross-chain messaging.

5. **Security Stack Selection**  
   LayerZero Endpoint selects a Security Stack by choosing Decentralized Verifier Networks (DVNs).

6. **Message Verification by DVNs**  
   The selected DVNs verify the message payload to ensure security.

7. **Executor Handles Message**  
   Upon successful verification, the message is handed over to an Executor for execution.

8. **Smart Contract Interaction**  
   - The Executor interacts with smart contracts for blockchain interactions.
   - Smart contracts manage the transaction logic.

9. **Blockchain Interaction**  
   The verified message interacts with smart contracts or blockchain states.

10. **Transaction Result Returned**  
    The result of the execution (token transfer) is returned to the DApp.

11. **Completion of Interaction**  
    The DApp displays the transaction result to the user, completing the interaction.

## Profit Orientation and Fee Structure

Qubex is designed to be a **community-driven platform with a fee model that benefits the ecosystem**.

- **Competitive Low-Fee Structure**: We will implement a total swap fee of **0.15% per transaction**, which is lower than the market average, making Qubex attractive to traders.

- **Fee Allocation**:
  - **Qubic Ecosystem Fund**: **5%** of the total swap fees will be allocated back to the fund, supporting the ecosystem's growth.
  - **Qubex Platform**: **15%** of the total swap fees will be retained by Qubex to cover operational costs and contribute to ongoing development.
  - **Liquidity Providers**: The remaining **80%** of the total swap fees will be allocated to liquidity providers; however, this percentage is **variable and will be determined based on market conditions** to ensure competitiveness and sustainability.

- **Future Fee Generation**: With the integration of the FIAT Ramp, additional fees will be generated, and a portion will also be allocated back to the Qubic Ecosystem Fund.

### Simplified Calculations

#### Per Transaction

Assumptions:

- **Transaction Amount**: $10,000
- **Total Swap Fee**: $10,000 × 0.15% = $15

Fee Allocation:

1. **Qubic Ecosystem Fund (5%)**:
   - $15 × 5% = **$0.75**

2. **Qubex Platform (15%)**:
   - $15 × 15% = **$2.25**

3. **Liquidity Providers (80%)**:
   - $15 × 80% = **$12.00** (Variable based on market conditions)

Outcome per Transaction:

- **User Pays**: $15 in fees (significantly lower than market average)
- **Qubic Receives**: $0.75
- **Qubex Platform Earns**: $2.25
- **LPs Earn**: $12.00 (Variable based on market conditions)

### Ensuring Long-Term Sustainability

- **Attractiveness to Traders**: By offering lower fees than competitors, we anticipate higher trading volumes.

- **Flexibility for Liquidity Providers**: Adjusting LP fees based on market conditions ensures we can attract and retain LPs effectively.

- **Increased Support for Qubic Ecosystem**: Allocating 5% of fees back to the Ecosystem Fund provides more resources for growth and development.

---

## Additional Costs
- **Additional Features**: For expansions beyond the initial scope, efforts and costs will be mutually agreed upon.

---

## Contractual Agreements

- **Specification Document**:
  - A detailed documentation of all technical and functional requirements will be provided as the basis for development work and quality assurance.

- **Payment Terms**:
  - **25% upfront payment upon contract signing**, which equates to **USD 24,750** of the total budget.
  - Funds will be held by the **Ecosystem Fund**, and subsequent payments will be released upon the successful completion of each milestone:
    - **25%** payment after completion of Step 1.
    - **25%** payment after completion of Step 2.
    - **25%** upon successful Go-Live and final acceptance.
