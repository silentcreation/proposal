- **Off-Site Storage:** Secure storage of backups in separate, reliable locations such as **Amazon S3** or **Google Cloud Storage** to ensure data recovery in case of regional failures.
- **Backup Validation:** Regular testing of backup restoration processes to ensure data integrity and availability.
- **Versioning:** Maintaining multiple backup versions to prevent data loss from faulty backups.

#### Bridge Implementation

The bridge functionality is a critical component of Qubex, enabling seamless cross-chain transactions between Ethereum, Qubic, and other supported blockchains. Here's how the bridge is implemented:

---

#### Transaction Flow for Cross-Chain Messaging

1. **User Initiates Transaction**  
   User initiates a transaction in the DApp, which triggers MetaMask Snap for wallet interaction.

2. **MetaMask Snap Initialized**  
   MetaMask Snap manages user wallet and transaction details.

3. **Transaction Forwarding**  
   MetaMask Snap forwards transaction details to LayerZero Endpoint V2 for cross-chain message handling.

4. **LayerZero Endpoint Version 2**  
   LayerZero protocol receives transaction details to enable cross-chain messaging.

5. **Security Stack Selection**  
   LayerZero Endpoint selects a Security Stack by choosing Decentralized Verifier Networks (DVNs).

6. **Select Security Stack (Decentralized Verifier Networks - DVNs)**  
   Choose the decentralized verifiers to ensure secure transaction verification.

7. **Message Verification by DVNs**  
   The selected DVNs verify the message payload to ensure security.

8. **Executor Handles Message**  
   Upon successful verification, the message is handed over to an Executor for execution.

9. **Executor (Optional) Executes Message**  
   An Executor initiates message execution on the target blockchain, if configured.

10. **Smart Contract Interaction (C++, Solidity)**  
    - Executor interacts with Smart Contracts for Qubic (C++) or USDT, USDC, ETH (Solidity).
    - Smart Contracts for Qubic (C++) and USDT, USDC, ETH (Solidity) manage the transaction logic.

11. **Blockchain Interaction**  
    The verified message interacts with smart contracts or blockchain states.

12. **Transaction Result Returned**  
    The result of the execution (e.g., token transfer) is returned to the DApp.

13. **Completion of Interaction**  
    The DApp displays the transaction result to the user, completing the interaction.
