# Budget Request to CCF

## Proposal

Request to fund the development of **Qubex**, a platform that enables asset trading and token exchange, for **110,000 USD (approximately 49 billion QUBIC)**.

### Available Options:

> **Option 0**: No, I don't want

> **Option 1**: Yes, allocate **49 billion QUBIC** to fund the development of Qubex

## Details

### What is Qubex?

We propose to develop **Qubex**, a platform that allows users to trade assets and exchange tokens within the Qubic ecosystem. Qubex will enable swapping of tokens such as **USDT, USDC, ETH to QUBIC and vice versa**, and is designed for future expansion to include additional cryptocurrencies. It will also lay the groundwork for potential integration of a **FIAT Ramp**, facilitating conversions between fiat currency and QUBIC, and provide additional features for possible adaptations to full exchanges.


## The Team

A dedicated team of **7-10** experienced professionals will be responsible for the development of Qubex, driving innovation within the Qubic ecosystem.

    - 2 focusing on frontend development with expertise in Next.js.
    - 2 focusing on backend development, smart contracts, and blockchain integrations.
  - Each developer has between 4 to 5 years of hands-on experience in blockchain development.

- **UX/UI Design Team**
  - Crafts an intuitive and seamless user experience.
  - Responsible for designing user interfaces that are both functional and visually appealing.

- **Additional Support**
  - Access to a network of professionals for specialized needs and support during the project lifecycle.

## Technical Implementation Overview

#### Tech Stack

To ensure the successful development and scalability of Qubex, we have selected a robust and modern tech stack:

- **Frontend:**
  - **Next.js**: For a performant and responsive user interface.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: For efficient and customizable styling.

- **Backend:**
  - **Solidity & C++**: For developing smart contracts compatible with Ethereum and Qubic.
  - **Rust**: For handling any additional processing needs if required.

- **Smart Contracts:**
  - **Solidity**: For Ethereum-based interactions.
  - **C++**: For Qubic compatibility.
  - **LayerZero.network**: For cross-chain bridging functionality. 

- **Database:**
  - **PostgreSQL**: For secure and efficient data storage.

- **Hosting & Infrastructure:**
  - **Ubuntu Servers**: For deploying production and staging environments.
  - **Docker**: For containerization and consistent deployment.

- **Security:**
  - **OWASP Best Practices**: To ensure secure software development.
  - **Third-Party Security Audits**: To validate the security of smart contracts and platform infrastructure.

#### Bridge Implementation

The bridge functionality is a critical component of Qubex, enabling seamless cross-chain transactions between Ethereum, Qubic, and other supported blockchains. Here's how the bridge is implemented:

#### Transaction Flow for Cross-Chain Messaging

1. **User Initiates Transaction**  
   User initiates a transaction in the DApp, which triggers MetaMask Snap for wallet interaction.

2. **MetaMask Snap Initialized**  
   MetaMask Snap manages user wallet and transaction details.

3. **Transaction Forwarding**  
   MetaMask Snap forwards transaction details to LayerZero Endpoint V2 for cross-chain message handling.

4. **LayerZero Endpoint Version 2**  
   LayerZero protocol receives transaction details to enable cross-chain messaging.

5. **Security Stack Selection**  
   LayerZero Endpoint selects a Security Stack by choosing Decentralized Verifier Networks (DVNs).

6. **Select Security Stack (Decentralized Verifier Networks - DVNs)**  
   Choose the decentralized verifiers to ensure secure transaction verification.

7. **Message Verification by DVNs**  
   The selected DVNs verify the message payload to ensure security.

8. **Executor Handles Message**  
   Upon successful verification, the message is handed over to an Executor for execution.

9. **Executor (Optional) Executes Message**  
   An Executor initiates message execution on the target blockchain, if configured.

10. **Smart Contract Interaction (C++, Solidity)**  
   - Executor interacts with Smart Contracts for Qubic (C++) or USDT, USDC, ETH (Solidity).
   - Smart Contracts for Qubic (C++) and USDT, USDC, ETH (Solidity) manage the transaction logic.

11. **Blockchain Interaction**  
   The verified message interacts with smart contracts or blockchain states.

12. **Transaction Result Returned**  
   The result of the execution (e.g., token transfer) is returned to the DApp.

13. **Completion of Interaction**  
   The DApp displays the transaction result to the user, completing the interaction.
